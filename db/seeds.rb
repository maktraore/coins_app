# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Receiver.all.delete_all
# 20.times do 
#   Receiver.create(

#     email:  Faker::Internet.email,
#     race: ['Responsive','Accurate','Courteous','Efficient'].sample,
#     department: ["CAEI", "Administrative Services", "Compliance Office", "Office for Teaching Excellence and Engaged Learning","President's Office","School of Liberal Arts"].sample,
